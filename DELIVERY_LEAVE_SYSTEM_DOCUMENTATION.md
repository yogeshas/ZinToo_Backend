|--------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| delivery_guy_id | Integer | Foreign key to delivery_onboarding |
| start_date | Date | Leave start date |
| end_date | Date | Leave end date |
| reason | Text | Reason for leave |
| status | String(20) | pending/approved/rejected |
| admin_notes | Text | Admin comments |
| created_at | DateTime | Request creation time |
| updated_at | DateTime | Last update time |

This system provides a complete solution for managing delivery personnel leave requests with proper authentication, validation, and user-friendly interfaces.
