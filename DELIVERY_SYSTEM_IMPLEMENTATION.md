## Database Schema

### DeliveryGuy Model
```python
class DeliveryGuy(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    phone_number = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, unique=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=True)
    vehicle_number = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=True)
    vehicle_type = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=True)  # bike, car, van
    status = db.Column(db.String(20), default="active")  # active, inactive, busy
    current_location = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=True)
    rating = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    total_deliveries = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    completed_deliveries = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
```

### Order Model Updates
```python
# Added to Order model:
delivery_guy_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("delivery_guy.id"), nullable=True)
assigned_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
delivery_notes = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
```

## API Endpoints
