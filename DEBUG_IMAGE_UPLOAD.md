# üîç Debug Image Upload - What You'll See

## Debug Logging Added

I've added comprehensive debug logging to track exactly what's happening when `yogeshas918899@gmail.com` tries to update their profile photos.

## What the Debug Logs Will Show

### 1. **Mobile App Side** (`api_service_updated.dart`)
```
üîç [DEBUG MOBILE APP] Making PUT request to update delivery onboarding: http://dev.zintoo.in:5000/api/delivery/onboard

## How to See the Debug Logs

1. **Check the terminal where your Flask app is running**
2. **Look for lines starting with üîç [DEBUG]**
3. **The logs will show exactly:**
   - What files are being sent from the mobile app
   - What files are received by the backend
   - Whether S3 uploads are successful
   - What data is being saved to the database
   - The final values in the database after update

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ **If Working Correctly:**
- All files show as "Found" and "Processing"
- S3 uploads show "‚úÖ [SUCCESS]"
- Database shows "Set field = URL"
- Final fields show the S3 URLs

### ‚ùå **If There's an Issue:**
- Files show as "not found in request files"
- S3 uploads show "‚ùå [ERROR]"
- Database shows "Field not found in onboarding model"
- Final fields still show "null"

## Next Steps

1. **Test the mobile app** - Try updating profile photos
2. **Check the terminal logs** - Look for the debug output
3. **Share the logs** - Copy the debug output so we can see exactly what's happening

The debug logs will tell us exactly where the problem is occurring!
