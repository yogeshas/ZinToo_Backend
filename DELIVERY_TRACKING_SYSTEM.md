# 🚚 Advanced Delivery Tracking System

## 📋 Overview
A comprehensive delivery tracking system that groups orders by status, shows different delivery types (normal, cancel pickup, exchange pickup), and provides an advanced Flutter UI with maps integration.

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### New Columns Added:
```sql
-- Added to exchange table
ALTER TABLE exchange 
ADD COLUMN delivery_track VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'normal' 
COMMENT 'normal, cancel_pickup, exchange_pickup';

-- Added to order_item table  
ALTER TABLE order_item 
ADD COLUMN delivery_track VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'normal' 
COMMENT 'normal, cancel_pickup, exchange_pickup';
```

## 🔧 Backend Logic

### Order Grouping Logic:
- **Groups orders by status** - Multiple order numbers with same status show as single entry
- **Determines overall status** based on all order items
- **Shows delivery track type** - Normal, Cancel Pickup, or Exchange Pickup
- **Smart status filtering** based on order-item statuses

### Status Determination:
```python
def _determine_overall_status(statuses, delivery_tracks):
    # Priority order:
    # 1. cancelled (any item cancelled = overall cancelled)
    # 2. delivered (all items delivered = delivered, else processing)
    # 3. out_for_delivery (any item out for delivery = out for delivery)
    # 4. processing (any item processing = processing)
    # 5. confirmed (any item confirmed = confirmed)
    # 6. pending (default)
```

### Delivery Track Priority:
```python
def _determine_delivery_track(delivery_tracks):
    # Priority: exchange_pickup > cancel_pickup > normal
    if "exchange_pickup" in delivery_tracks:
        return "exchange_pickup"
    elif "cancel_pickup" in delivery_tracks:
        return "cancel_pickup"
    else:
        return "normal"
```
